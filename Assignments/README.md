# Assignments

This section contains hands-on problem sets designed to reinforce Machine Learning concepts through real data, practical implementation, and interview-focused thinking.

## Why Assignments Matter

- **Bridge theory and real-world ML**: Move from understanding concepts to applying them

- **Portfolio building**: Create projects to showcase your skills

## How to Use This Section

1. **Read the Problem Set README**: Understand the objectives and concepts covered
2. **Explore the provided dataset**: Perform exploratory data analysis
3. **Implement solutions independently**: Try to solve without looking at solutions first
4. **Compare with the provided solution**: Learn different approaches and best practices
5. **Reflect on mistakes and improvements**: Understand what worked and what didn't

## What You Will Learn

- **Data preprocessing**: Handling missing values, feature scaling, encoding
- **Model training and evaluation**: Choosing algorithms, tuning parameters, validating performance
- **Debugging ML pipelines**: Identifying and fixing common issues
- **Writing clean, interview-ready code**: Practices that impress employers
- **Error analysis**: Understanding model failures and how to improve
- **Feature engineering**: Creating better representations of data
- **Model selection**: Choosing appropriate algorithms for different problems

## Assignment-Topic Mapping

Each problem set focuses on specific concepts from the course:

| Problem Set | Core Topics | Difficulty |
|-------------|-------------|------------|
| **Problem Set 1** | Linear Regression, LMS, Linear Algebra | Beginner |
| **Problem Set 2** | Logistic Regression, GDA, Naive Bayes | Intermediate |
| **Problem Set 3** | SVM, Kernels, Decision Trees, Boosting | Intermediate |
| **Problem Set 4** | Neural Networks, Backpropagation, Reinforcement Learning | Advanced |

## Structure of Each Problem Set

Each problem set contains:

- **Problem README**: Objectives, tasks, datasets, expected outputs

- **Solution README**: Detailed walkthrough of the approach

## Tips for Success

### Before Starting
- Review the relevant course sections first
- Set up your Python environment (NumPy, pandas, scikit-learn)
- Allocate sufficient time (4-8 hours per problem set)
- Have a notebook ready for experimentation

### While Working
- Start with exploratory data analysis
- Establish a simple baseline first
- Iterate and improve incrementally
- Document your thought process
- Test edge cases

### After Completing
- Compare your solution with the provided one
- Understand alternative approaches
- Practice explaining your solution aloud
- Refactor code for clarity
- Add visualizations for insights

## Interview Preparation

These assignments mirror real ML interview problems. Practice:

### Technical Explanations
- **Data preprocessing decisions**: Why you chose certain techniques
- **Model selection rationale**: Trade-offs of different algorithms
- **Hyperparameter choices**: How you tuned parameters
- **Evaluation strategy**: Why you used specific metrics

### Coding Best Practices
- Clean, readable code with meaningful variable names
- Proper documentation and comments
- Modular functions (not one giant script)
- Error handling
- Efficient vectorized operations

### Problem-Solving Process
1. Understand the problem and data
2. Establish baseline
3. Try simple models first
4. Analyze errors
5. Iterate improvements
6. Validate thoroughly

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

### Data Mistakes
- ❌ Not exploring data before modeling
- ❌ Forgetting to split train/validation/test
- ❌ Data leakage (test info in training)
- ❌ Not handling missing values properly
- ❌ Ignoring class imbalance

### Modeling Mistakes
- ❌ Starting with complex models
- ❌ Not establishing baseline
- ❌ Overfitting to training data
- ❌ Using wrong evaluation metrics
- ❌ Not cross-validating

### Code Mistakes
- ❌ Using loops instead of vectorization
- ❌ Hard-coding values
- ❌ No error handling
- ❌ Poor variable names
- ❌ Not modularizing code

## Submission Guidelines (If Using for a Course)

If you're completing these as part of a course or for review:

1. **Code**: Well-commented Python scripts or Jupyter notebooks
2. **Report**: PDF explaining your approach, results, and insights
3. **Visualizations**: Plots showing data analysis and model performance
4. **README**: Brief description of your solution

## Getting Help

If you get stuck:

1. **Review course materials**: Go back to relevant sections
2. **Check documentation**: NumPy, pandas, scikit-learn docs
3. **Error analysis**: Understand what's failing and why
4. **Simplify**: Try a simpler version of the problem first
5. **Compare with solution**: Learn from the provided approach

## Assessment Criteria
